# Portable Hook Invariants

This document names the runtime-neutral invariants enforced by hook scripts.
It is not a hook registration file. Runtime adapters decide how to attach these
checks to their own event model.

## Status Classes

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `portable-check` | Core decision logic is runtime-neutral and has a CLI entry point. It may also accept Claude hook JSON for compatibility. |
| `adapter-payload-wrapper` | Primarily translates a runtime event payload into a portable decision. Needs adapter-specific wrapper for non-Claude runtimes. |
| `adapter-coupled-automation` | Depends on Claude session lifecycle, status, MCP, or headless `claude -p`. Other runtimes must implement their own equivalent or mark unsupported. |
| `external-integration` | Owned by an external integration and not part of the portable contract. |
| `test` | Local regression test for a hook implementation. |

## Invariant Catalog

| Invariant | Current script | Status | Portable meaning | Non-Claude adapter requirement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| artifact order | `hooks/artifact-guard.sh` | `portable-check` | New tracked artifacts must be created in dependency order: spec after research/analysis, plans after spec, documents after research/analysis. | Run `hooks/artifact-guard.sh --file <path> [--session <id>]` before writes, or use an adapter wrapper. |
| git state safety | `hooks/git-state-guard.sh` | `portable-check` | Do not edit files in merge/rebase/cherry-pick/detached unsafe git states unless explicitly unlocked. | Run `hooks/git-state-guard.sh --file <path>` before file edits, or use an adapter wrapper. |
| spec read gate | `hooks/spec-skill-gate.sh`, `hooks/spec-read-marker.sh` | `portable-check` | Spec-changing capability calls in spec-backed projects require a current `prd.md` read marker. | Run `hooks/spec-read-marker.sh --file <prd.md> [--session <id>]` after actual reads, then `hooks/spec-skill-gate.sh --skill <capability> [--cwd <dir>] [--session <id>]` before spec/code capabilities. |
| memory write guard | `hooks/builtin-memory-guard.sh` | `portable-check` | Runtime-native file memory must not bypass the unified DB memory store. | Run `hooks/builtin-memory-guard.sh --file <path>` before writes, or remove the native memory feature. |
| design post-write verification | `hooks/design-postwrite.sh` | `adapter-coupled-automation` | Saved design HTML should get deterministic console verification. | Provide an equivalent browser/console checker or report unsupported. |
| workflow tracked signal | `utilities/workflow-guard-hook.sh` | `portable-check` | Surface tracked/untracked mode and clean stale flags. | Run `utilities/workflow-guard-hook.sh --event prompt [--cwd <dir>] [--session <id>] [--format text]` before prompt handling, and `--event start` for stale flag GC. |
| memory injection | `tools/memory/mem.py inject` | `portable-check` | Inject relevant DB memory at session start. | Run `tools/memory/mem.py inject` for text output, or `tools/memory/mem.py inject --hook` when the runtime accepts Claude-style `additionalContext`. |
| memory recall injection | `hooks/mem-recall-inject.sh` | `adapter-coupled-automation` | Recall signal words trigger DB recall and context injection. | Provide prompt-submit event payload and context injection support. |
| memory distillation trigger | `hooks/mem-turn-nudge.sh`, `hooks/mem-distill-dispatch.sh` | `adapter-coupled-automation` | Periodically distill session deltas into DB memory through a no-tools worker. | Provide session transcript source, detached worker invocation, and no-tools/action contract. |
| oncall briefing injection | `hooks/mem-briefing-inject.sh` | `adapter-coupled-automation` | On the dedicated agent desk, inject daily oncall report once per day. | Provide cwd/session prompt event and context injection, or mark unsupported. |
| Herdr state integration | `hooks/herdr-agent-state.sh` | `external-integration` | Publish working/idle/blocked/release state to Herdr. | Optional external integration; not a core invariant. |

## Adapter Rule

Adapters may reuse scripts directly only when they can supply the expected input
payload and consume the expected output decision. Otherwise, the invariant must
be wrapped or reimplemented behind an adapter-native event bridge.

Current Claude Code registration lives in `adapters/claude/settings.json`.
Codex must not consume that JSON as configuration. It can run
`adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]` before edits
(git state, artifact order, and native memory-file write checks),
`adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh read <prd.md> [session-id]` after actual spec
reads, and `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability <name> [cwd] [session-id]`
before spec-changing capability work. It can also run
`adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh mode [cwd] [session-id]` to surface tracked
or untracked workflow state as plain text, and
`adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh memory [cwd]` for plain-text memory injection.
