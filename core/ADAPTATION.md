# Adaptation Contract

This document defines how the neutral harness becomes a runtime-specific setting.
It is the boundary contract for `claude_setting/`, `codex_setting/`, and future
runtime projections.

## 1. Source Categories

Every file in this repo must fall into one category.

| Category | Meaning | Examples | Runtime projection rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Portable source | Runtime-neutral semantics. Describes what must happen, not how a vendor runtime invokes it. | `core/`, portable parts of `tools/`, portable guard algorithms | May be symlinked into adapters if the runtime can read plain files |
| Adapter source | Runtime-specific representation of portable semantics. | `adapters/claude/CLAUDE.md`, `adapters/claude/settings.json`, `adapters/claude/commands/` | Projected into that runtime home |
| Adapter projection | Versioned mirror that exposes adapter source under runtime-expected names. | `claude_setting/`, `codex_setting/` | Symlink or generated output only; no independent semantics |
| Compatibility passthrough | Legacy file still consumed directly by a runtime before a true portable/adapted split exists. | Current `skills/`, many `hooks/` | Allowed only with an explicit debt note in the adapter |
| Runtime state | Tool-owned mutable local state. | `~/.claude/projects`, credentials, session logs, caches, DB files | Never committed to this repo |

## 2. Adapter Rule

An adapter must not claim support for a surface unless it provides one of:

1. A native adapter file.
2. A generated file with a documented source.
3. An explicit compatibility passthrough entry and the reason passthrough is safe.

Plain symlinks are acceptable only as a projection mechanism. They are not proof
that adaptation is complete.

## 3. Portable Role Model

Portable docs use role names, not vendor model names:

| Portable role | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fast reviewer` | Broad, low-latency review: coverage, style, cross-reference, formatting, simple consistency |
| `fast fact-checker` | Narrow source comparison: citations, years, metrics, verbatim matching |
| `fast writer` | Assembly from verified artifacts |
| `fast implementer` | Routine implementation and refactoring |
| `deep reviewer` | Architecture, methodology, safety, domain correctness, high-risk review |
| `deep maker` | High-judgment creation: planning, synthesis, visual/editorial craft |
| `external adversary` | Independent reviewer with different model/runtime/process assumptions |
| `orchestrator` | Tooling, merge, dispatch, and report assembly; should not be the sole judge |

Adapters map these roles to concrete models, reasoning profiles, or tools.
Concrete model names such as `sonnet`, `opus`, or `gpt-*` belong in adapter
documents or generated native files.

## 4. Capability Model

A portable capability describes:

- trigger semantics;
- required inputs and artifact roots;
- output contract;
- QA level semantics;
- delegation roles using the portable role model;
- deterministic guards and side effects;
- recovery and audit requirements.

A runtime skill/slash command/native instruction describes:

- how that runtime invokes the capability;
- which tools are available;
- how subagents or reviewers are spawned;
- how confirmation, pause, and user input work;
- how hook events are attached;
- runtime-specific file formats and frontmatter.

Current `skills/*/SKILL.md` files are compatibility references. Claude Code
consumes adapter-owned concrete files under
`adapters/claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Portable capability meaning belongs in
`capabilities/`.

## 5. Hook Model

Portable hook semantics are named by invariant:

| Invariant | Portable meaning |
|---|---|
| artifact order | New artifacts must be created in the allowed dependency order |
| git state safety | Do not edit during merge/rebase/cherry-pick/detached unsafe states |
| spec read gate | Spec-backed work must read the current blueprint before changing code/spec |
| memory write guard | Runtime-native memory files must not bypass the unified memory store |
| workflow signal | Surface tracked/untracked mode to the active agent |
| memory recall/inject/distill | Inject relevant memory and optionally distill session deltas |

Adapters decide whether each invariant is enforced by native hook, wrapper,
manual preflight, or unsupported fallback.

## 6. Projection Invariant

Runtime homes keep their expected names:

```text
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
~/.claude/settings.json
~/.claude/commands/

~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

Those paths may symlink into versioned projection directories such as
`claude_setting/` or `codex_setting/`. The projection directory must make it
clear whether each entry is native adapter output, portable passthrough, or
compatibility debt.
