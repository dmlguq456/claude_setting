## Language Rule
- All user-facing output in natural Korean (no translationese — write Korean natively, don't translate from an English draft).

## Argument Parsing
Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **mode**: first word — `rebuttal | paper | review | report | proposal | presentation`
- **--inputs <comma-separated-paths>**: comma-joined list of pre-discovered input paths (from autopilot-draft Pre-flight Step 2 Input Discovery — typically `analysis_project/{paper,doc}/...` and/or `research/{topic}/`). Each path is an artifact directory containing pre-analyzed materials.
- **--output <dir>**: artifact output directory (`.claude_reports/documents/{date}_{name}/`)
- **--qa <level>**: `quick | light | standard | thorough | adversarial` — overrides auto-detect (autopilot-draft propagates this). 단일 source: [`CONVENTIONS.md §1`](../../CONVENTIONS.md#1-qa-levels-canonical)
- Remaining text: task description / context

## Pre-Check
- Verify analysis files exist in `{output_dir}/analysis/`:
  - `material_index.md` (required for all modes)
  - `reviewer_analysis.md` (required for rebuttal mode)
  - `ref_analysis.md` (required for paper/review/report/proposal/presentation modes)
- If missing, report error — autopilot-draft Step 1 should have created these.

## Delegate to 연구팀
Invoke the **research-team** (연구팀) agent as a subagent with the following prompt:

````
Document strategy mode. Create an initial {mode} strategy document.

Mode: {mode}
Task: {task description}
Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
Pre-discovered input paths (from autopilot-draft): {inputs_paths_list}
Analysis directory: {output_dir}/analysis/
Save English strategy to: {output_dir}/strategy/strategy.md
Target venues (for academic modes): NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ICASSP, Interspeech, IEEE/ACM T-ASLP

## Inputs
1. Read all analysis files in the analysis directory (material_index.md, reviewer_analysis.md or ref_analysis.md)
2. Read pre-analyzed materials from the discovered input paths (each path is a `analysis_project/{paper,doc}/{name}/` or `research/{topic}/` artifact — use the structured analysis files there, NOT external raw PDFs)
3. Consider venue-specific conventions and expectations (for academic modes: rebuttal/paper/review) or domain best practices and industry standards (for professional modes: report/proposal/presentation)

## Paragraph Cohesion Pre-Check (mandatory before every paste-ready block — **all modes**)

This rule applies to **every doc-strategy mode** (rebuttal / paper / review / report / proposal / presentation). Before writing any paste-ready block (LaTeX / markdown / slide bullet / table-row), run this **4-step self-check on the target paragraph as a whole**:

1. **Is the substance already stated?** — read every existing sentence in the target paragraph. If the same content (terminology, framing, claim, cross-ref) is already there, **do NOT add a separate sentence**; route through in-line edit instead.
2. **What is the paragraph axis?** — most well-formed paragraphs follow a clear axis (e.g., *motivation → design → formalization*, *claim → evidence → caveat*, *context → contribution → comparison*). Verify the new sentence does not break that transition. Insertions immediately before/after equation blocks, figure cascades, or table introductions require extra care.
3. **Cross-section redundancy** — if another paragraph (§-level / slide-level) already covers the substance, **DROP** or compress to a minimal cross-ref. Same substance must not be repeated at multiple canonical sites.
4. **Choose edit type** — combine results of 1-3 into one of four classifications, ordered by cohesion strength:
   - **EDIT (in-line parenthetical / word insertion / reword)** — terminology, cross-ref, or alternative folds naturally into an existing sentence. **Highest cohesion; prefer this whenever possible**.
   - **REPLACE** — rewrite an existing sentence to absorb the new substance, preserving the narrative arc.
   - **INSERT (new sentence)** — only when the paragraph has zero overlapping content AND a natural slot that does not break the axis exists.
   - **DROP** — another paragraph/section already states it → delete from the new mutation list.

**Anti-patterns (forbidden — auto-reject the mutation)**:
- *Mechanical "INSERT after sentence X"* without analyzing the paragraph flow — especially right before equation blocks, figure cascades, or table introductions, which breaks the narrative.
- *BEFORE / AFTER diffs where AFTER is longer than BEFORE* due to cross-ref bloat or restated substance — contradicts the compression intent.
- *Same substance repeated at §-level* (one paragraph states X, another paragraph re-states X via cross-ref) — keep exactly one canonical site; others must use cross-ref or DROP.
- *Trailing sentence appended after a "design choice" sentence that already names the choice* — the new content overlaps with the design-choice sentence and should be folded in via EDIT, not appended.

**Why** (2026-05-20 incident, ICML 2026 camera-ready M8 / M9): M8 paste-ready ignored the existing *"we share the same projection layer..."* sentence and appended a separate trailing INSERT, breaking the transition to the next equation block. M9 restated a §3.2 conditional-information-flow paragraph inside §3.3 P2 via cross-ref, increasing verbosity rather than compressing it. The user's explicit feedback was *"그걸 삽입할 단락의 전체 cohesive, coherence를 고려해야하는데"* — every paste-ready mutation must be designed against the target paragraph's full cohesion/coherence, not in isolation. This 4-step pre-check operationalizes that judgment so the failure mode does not repeat across modes.

#### Natural-integration rule for paper-body mutations (camera-ready / major revision)

> **First apply the top-level [Paragraph Cohesion Pre-Check](#paragraph-cohesion-pre-check-mandatory-before-every-paste-ready-block--all-modes) (4-step) to choose between EDIT / REPLACE / INSERT / DROP.** The paper-body extension below adds rebuttal-material-specific gates on top.

When converting **reviewer concerns / rebuttal materials → paper-body mutations**, apply this **single gating question** before writing any paste-ready block:

> **"Can this reviewer point be naturally integrated into the existing paragraph flow as a 1-2 sentence inline rewrite?"**

- **YES → inline rewrite mutation** (M15-style — good pattern):
  - Label the subsection heading + add 1-2 opening sentences that introduce the framing.
  - Reword the existing paragraph's first sentence to remove redundancy with the new opening (no orphan additions).
  - Connect Figure references in cascade (overall → architectural → unit-module — single zoom-in path).
  - Defer experimental numbers / hyperparameters / verbatim table citations to body paragraphs or Appendix — never inject them into opening / intro paragraphs.
- **NO → drop (or defer to Appendix)** (M11-style — bad pattern, must reject):
  - Anything that exists only as a **rebuttal-format artifact** — model-by-model comparison tables, structured Q&A blocks, point-by-point response paragraphs, "we acknowledge X, Y, Z" enumerations — does NOT belong as a paper-body mutation. Even if the reviewer "strongly recommended integration," a rebuttal-format block pasted verbatim into a camera-ready section will read as awkward and out-of-flow.
  - Mark the mutation as **dropped** in the strategy, with a one-line reason ("rebuttal-format — not naturally integrable into body flow"). If a fragment of the rebuttal material *can* be salvaged as inline body wording, extract only that fragment as an inline rewrite; do NOT preserve the surrounding structure.

**Hard-fail check** — when drafting mutation entries, an entry MUST be rejected if any of the following holds (these are signals that the mutation is mechanically copying a rebuttal artifact rather than integrating naturally):
1. The paste-ready block is a **standalone `\begin{table}` or `\begin{itemize}` enumeration** sourced from rebuttal materials, with no embedding paragraph rewriting around it.
2. The paste-ready block contains verbatim **experiment numbers** ($x.xx \to y.yy$ migrations, hyperparameter listings, dataset enumerations) inside what should be an introductory / framing paragraph.
3. The paste-ready block is **a new `\paragraph{...}` INSERT** that the existing surrounding text does not bridge to — the surrounding paragraphs would still read identically with or without the inserted block, indicating it sits in isolation rather than weaving into the flow.

**Why** (this rule was added 2026-05-19 after the M11 / M15 episode): a previous camera-ready cycle mechanically converted every reviewer concern into a paper-body mutation, producing rebuttal-format tables (e.g., `tab:arch_compare` model comparison) as 🔴 mandatory body inserts. The user explicitly rejected this as "rebuttal자료를 본문에 그대로 가져다 붙이는 게 어색하다 — 자연스럽게 문장으로 녹여 넣을 수 있으면 그렇게 해야지". The natural-integration rule above operationalizes that judgment so future cycles don't repeat the mechanical conversion.

#### Paste-ready cheatsheet 형식 (사용자 영역 vs 추적 영역 분리)

paper mode 산출물이 _카드 묶음 cheatsheet_ (camera-ready / major revision / 명시적 `subtype: camera-ready-paste-ready`) 인 경우, draft 본문 형식은 `~/.claude/skills/autopilot-draft/SKILL.md` 의 paper mode "Paste-ready cheatsheet 형식 강제" 섹션이 단일 출처. Strategy 작성 시점에 _향후 draft 의 형식이 그 규칙을 따를 것이라는 점을 전제_ 로 mutation 목록 / paste 순서 / 분기점을 설계.

핵심 — strategy 안 mutation 목록도 _카드 단위_ 로 (한 entry = 위치 한 줄 + paste-ready LaTeX 한 줄 또는 reference + 짧은 이유). Reviewer 매핑 / dependency 표 / Wording invariant 같은 추적용 메타는 strategy 본문에도 _별도 섹션 (§Reviewer mapping / §Dependency map)_ 으로 묶어 본문 흐름과 분리. draft 생성 단계에서 그 추적 섹션은 `_internal/draft_meta.md` 로 옮겨지고 본문 entry 옆에는 안 박힌다.

```

### Tone Auto-Detection (modes: report / proposal / presentation) — **FIRST step before drafting any of the three above templates**

Infer audience tone from the task description and set `tone:` in the strategy frontmatter. **The detected tone propagates to draft generation in autopilot-draft Step 4** — the draft must respect the same constraints.

| Tone | Detection signals | Style constraints |
|---|---|---|
| **administrative** | Task contains Korean keywords "위원회 / 심의 / 사전심의 / 산학협력단 / **정부** / 정부 기관 / 규제 / 검토 요청 / 보고 / 평가단 / 이사회 / 감사 / 사업 보고 / 사후 보고" or English equivalents ("committee / regulatory / **government** / agency review / compliance / board review / pre-screening / audit / status report"); speaker is a student or researcher reporting **upward** to decision-makers (the committee evaluates the speaker; the speaker is NOT pitching to peers or selling). Goal: information presentation + review request, NOT persuasion / sales / investor pitch. | **Plain factual delivery, objective information.** AVOID: marketing superlatives ("genuinely novel", "sole occupied axis", "global rights asset", "world-first"), "X strengths summary" framing, "core message" / "Hook → Call-to-Action" arc, heroic asks ("Approve to secure as global asset"), decision-options box (approve/conditional/hold), animated narrative voice. PREFER: simple fact lists, status updates, calm review request ("검토 부탁드립니다" / "kindly request the committee's review"). Speaker stance: **neutral reporter, not advocate**. |
| **default** | Otherwise — academic conference talk, internal R&D briefing, industry pitch, sales/marketing presentation, investor IR | Existing pitch-deck patterns apply (Hook, Core Message, Story Arc, Call-to-Action, persuasive framing). |

**Why this matters**: Korean administrative presentations (산학협력단 사전심의, 정부 위원회 보고, 규제 기관 사후 보고 등) follow a fundamentally different convention from English-language pitch decks. Without this guard, default LLM patterns lean toward US/English pitch-deck superlatives ("compelling contribution", "single-axis advantage", "secured as a global asset") that are uncomfortable for student presenters and inappropriate for the audience. The same applies to administrative reports/proposals submitted to government agencies or institutional review boards.

### Slide Format Conventions (mode: presentation) — **mandatory in slide outline (Section 4)**

When the strategy includes a slide-by-slide outline (presentation mode Section 4), each slide entry MUST follow these formatting principles. **The same conventions propagate to draft generation in autopilot-draft Step 4.**

**1. Chapter visualization in slide headers**
- Every body-slide title prefixed with `[Ch.N 챕터명]` (Korean) or `[Ch.N Chapter-name]` (English)
- Chapter-transition slides marked with `[Ch.N 챕터명 — 시작]` / `[~ start]`
- Each slide includes a `**챕터**: N. 챕터명 (M장 중 K번째)` meta line below the title — chapter-transition slides add "**챕터 전환**" annotation
- Visual placeholder's first line: `- **상단 헤더 띠**: "N. 챕터명"` (per format-ref Korean industry-academia standard deck) — chapter-transition slides add "Ch.X와 색상/strength를 다르게 — 챕터 전환 시각 신호"

**2. Visual placeholder concreteness**
- AVOID vague terms: "X 카드", "Y 도식", "적절한 시각화", "comparison chart"
- PREFER: (a) diagram type + (b) component list + (c) color/layout hints
- Example: ❌ "학회 위상 카드" → ✅ "NeurIPS / ICLR / ICML 3-row table (h5-index 컬럼 + acceptance-rate 컬럼)"

**3. Table column header clarity**
- AVOID abbreviations or ambiguous headers (e.g., "비교 1위" — comparison with what?)
- PREFER: full Korean/English noun phrases with clear semantic units; add a 1-line column-meaning footnote above the table if helpful

**4. Foreign-language quote → Korean keyword gloss** (mandatory for non-AI audiences)
- Whenever a slide contains an English quote (paper review, citation, technical term), add a Korean appeal-commentary box directly below:
  ```
  > "English quote..."
  > — Source

  📌 **핵심 키워드 — "X"**: 한국어 풀이 1문장
  ```

**5. Speaker notes default = empty**
- The strategy outline and the initial draft leave speaker notes empty by default
- Only generate speaker notes when the user explicitly requests as a separate post-polish step
- Reason: speaker notes drift with slide-content edits; auto-fill produces wasted regeneration cost in iterative refinement

**6. No body-bullet ↔ visual redundancy**
- The same fact should NOT appear both in body bullets AND in the visual placeholder
- Body bullets = "what the speaker says"; visual = "what the audience sees at-a-glance"
- If both express the same fact, simplify one of the two

**7. Slide-number consistency on insertion/deletion**
- When inserting/removing a slide, update ALL of the following in the same edit pass:
  - (a) All subsequent slide numbers (`Slide N+1`, `Slide N+2`, ...)
  - (b) Contents slide's chapter slide-counts ("Ch.N (M장)")
  - (c) Changelog entry inside the frontmatter `changelog:` array (per `draft-refine` convention — never a top-of-file HTML comment, which breaks markdown preview when frontmatter is present)
  - (d) Time-budget line in the file's top guide
  - (e) Cross-references in other slides ("Slide M의 ...")
  - (f) Chapter meta lines ("M장 중 K번째")

## Quality Requirements
Every reviewer point must appear in rebuttal strategy (missing a point is a critical error). Severity classification must be justified. All citations must reference actual materials in the discovered input paths (analysis_project/{paper,doc}/, research/{topic}/) — do NOT fabricate. Strategy must be actionable with specific plans, not vague advice. For academic modes (rebuttal/paper/review): apply venue-specific norms (e.g., NeurIPS rebuttal length limits, ICASSP culture). For professional modes (report/proposal/presentation): apply industry best practices relevant to the domain.

Write the strategy file directly. Return ONLY the file path and a 3-5 line Korean summary of the strategy. Do NOT return the strategy content itself.
````

The agent writes the strategy file directly; the orchestrator only receives paths and a summary.

## QA Scaling
Auto-detect from strategy scope. Two reviewer roles run **in parallel** at Standard+:
- **Quality reviewer** (품질관리팀): completeness / logical soundness / venue norms / reviewer-coverage (rebuttal)
- **Fact-checker** (연구팀 subrole): in-artifact materials verbatim 대조 (`analysis_project/paper/cards/*.md`, `analysis_project/doc/*/...`, `research/{topic}/cards/*.md`), citation/venue/metric/year 검증. classification 8-row table 의 canonical 정의는 [`research-team.md`](../../agents/research-team.md) L258-300 single source.

| Level | Condition | Quality reviewer | Fact-checker (parallel) | Max rounds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | (manual via `--qa quick` only) | 1× 품질관리팀 (`model: "sonnet"`), spot-check만 | _skip_ | **1 (no re-invoke even on 🔴)** |
| **Light** | review/presentation mode, or report with ≤3 input paths | 1× 품질관리팀 (`model: "sonnet"`) | _skip_ | 2 |
| **Standard** | paper/report/proposal mode, or rebuttal with ≤3 reviewers | 1× 품질관리팀 (default opus) | **1× 연구팀 fact-checker (`model: "sonnet"`)** | 2 |
| **Thorough** | rebuttal with ≥4 reviewers, or report/proposal with ≥10 input items (papers + doc materials) | 2× 품질관리팀 in parallel (opus) | **1× 연구팀 fact-checker (`model: "sonnet"`)** | 2 |
| **Adversarial** | external-review-imminent (camera-ready / submission / public report), or manual via `--qa adversarial` | 2× 품질관리팀 in parallel (opus) + 1× `Agent(codex-review-team)` (Codex CLI external review) | **1× 연구팀 fact-checker (`model: "sonnet"`)** | 2 + Codex 1 |

**Why Sonnet for fact-checker**: in-artifact cards verbatim 대조는 _창의적 판단_이 아닌 _단순 매칭 작업_이라 Sonnet으로 충분, 비용 효율적.

## Post-Strategy Review Loop (max 2 revision rounds; quick = 1 round)
The log directory is the artifact root folder (parent of `strategy/`).
- `mkdir -p {log_dir}/_internal/strategy_reviews` before invoking QA.

After the 연구팀 agent returns:
1. **Invoke quality + fact-check reviewers in parallel** (single message with multiple Agent calls per QA Scaling):

   **Quality reviewer prompt** (opus or sonnet per level):
   ```
   Review this document strategy for completeness and logical soundness.
   Strategy file: [path]. Mode: {mode}.
   For rebuttal mode, verify ALL reviewer points are addressed.
   Do NOT verify individual fact citations (model venue/year/metric) — that's the fact-checker's role.
   Write review to: {log_dir}/_internal/strategy_reviews/round_{N}_quality.md.
   Return ONLY the file path and a one-line verdict.
   ```

   **Fact-checker prompt** (sonnet, parallel — Standard/Thorough only):
   ```
   You are a fact-check focused reviewer — NOT narrative quality.
   Strategy file: [path]. Mode: {mode}. Discovered inputs: {inputs_paths_list}.

   For every domain claim in the strategy (citation / model name / venue / year /
   metric / dataset / lineage / classification), open the corresponding ground-truth
   source and verbatim compare:
   - Paper analyses: `.claude_reports/analysis_project/paper/*.md` (if exists — single source of truth, produced by `/analyze-project --mode paper`)
   - Original PDFs: only if listed in `--inputs` AND paper analyses lack the specific fact
   - Reviewer comments (rebuttal mode): {analysis_dir}/reviewer_analysis.md

   Output a single table (no narrative):
   | Section | Claim in strategy | Source (file:line or section) | Match (✅/❌) | Severity (🔴/🟡) |

   Do NOT comment on completeness, narrative arc, or strategic soundness
   — that's the quality reviewer's job. Stay narrowly on fact verification.

   Cost-aware mode (sonnet): table-only output. Limit to ~30 most material claims.

   Write to: {log_dir}/_internal/strategy_reviews/round_{N}_factcheck.md.
   Return ONLY path + one-line verdict.
   ```

2. **Check verdict (both reviewers):**
   - **No 🔴 from either**: proceed to Korean Version Generation.
   - **qa_level == quick**: after round 1, exit regardless of 🔴. Add 🔴 issues to `## 미해결 이슈` section in the strategy. Proceed to Korean Version Generation.
   - **🔴 from quality reviewer**: re-invoke 연구팀 with quality findings (max 2 rounds).
   - **🔴 from fact-checker**: re-invoke 연구팀 with **mandatory ref-grounding** (re-read named cards/PDFs). Max 2 rounds.
   - **🔴 from both**: re-invoke 연구팀 with combined findings.
3. **If 🔴 issues remain after 2 rounds**: Add to `## 미해결 이슈` section in the strategy, report to user. Tag fact-check residuals with `[FACT-RESIDUAL]`.

## Mirror Generation (편집팀 — conditional, NOT default)

**Skip condition (default)**: strategy primary language == 사용자 작업 언어. strategy.md 자체가 사용자 영역 산출이라 mirror 단계가 불필요.

**Trigger**: strategy primary language ≠ 사용자 작업 언어 (예: academic paper strategy in English, 한국어 사용자 → strategy_ko.md mirror). 그때만 편집팀 모드 A 호출.

```
모드 A — {원본 언어}에서 {대상 언어}로 옮기기.
원본 strategy 경로: {strategy_path}
대상 출력 경로: {same directory}/strategy_{ko|en}.md
~/.claude/agents/editorial-team.md 의 모드 A 절차를 따른다.
~/.claude/agents/editorial-team.md 의 판교체 회피 절을 강제 적용 (한국어 산출 시). 사용자 표기 선호는 `mem profile 02_paper_writing_style` 보조 참조.
LaTeX 명령·논문 제목·학회 이름·약자·모델 이름·데이터셋·지표는 원본 언어 그대로, 그 외 일반 표현은 대상 언어로.
완료 시 파일 경로 + 한국어 요약 3-5 줄 + 의도적으로 한 표기 결정 한두 개만 돌려준다.
```

> Primary language 는 autopilot-draft SKILL.md 의 mode/subtype 표를 따름 (paper academic body → English / paper paste-ready cheatsheet → Korean / rebuttal·review → venue / presentation·report·proposal → audience). 사용자가 task description 에서 명시한 언어가 1순위 override.

Then report to the user: strategy path(s) + summary + QA verdict.
