description: Create an initial document strategy (rebuttal/paper/review/report/proposal/presentation) based on analyzed reference materials
argument-hint: "<mode> --inputs <comma-separated-paths> --output <artifact-dir> [--qa quick|light|standard|thorough] <task description>"
---

## Language Rule
- Think and reason in English internally.
- Write all user-facing output in Korean.

## Argument Parsing
Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **mode**: first word — `rebuttal | paper | review | report | proposal | presentation`
- **--inputs <comma-separated-paths>**: comma-joined list of pre-discovered input paths (from autopilot-doc Pre-flight Step 2 Input Discovery — typically `analysis_project/{paper,doc}/...` and/or `research/{topic}/`). Each path is an artifact directory containing pre-analyzed materials.
- **--output <dir>**: artifact output directory (`.claude_reports/documents/{date}_{name}/`)
- **--qa <level>**: `quick | light | standard | thorough` — overrides auto-detect (autopilot-doc propagates this)
- Remaining text: task description / context

## Pre-Check
- Verify analysis files exist in `{output_dir}/analysis/`:
  - `material_index.md` (required for all modes)
  - `reviewer_analysis.md` (required for rebuttal mode)
  - `ref_analysis.md` (required for paper/review/report/proposal/presentation modes)
- If missing, report error — autopilot-doc Step 1 should have created these.

## Delegate to 연구팀
Invoke the **research-team** (연구팀) agent as a subagent with the following prompt:

````
Document strategy mode. Create an initial {mode} strategy document.

Mode: {mode}
Task: {task description}
Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
Pre-discovered input paths (from autopilot-doc): {inputs_paths_list}
Analysis directory: {output_dir}/analysis/
Save English strategy to: {output_dir}/strategy/strategy.md
Target venues (for academic modes): NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ICASSP, Interspeech, IEEE/ACM T-ASLP

## Inputs
1. Read all analysis files in the analysis directory (material_index.md, reviewer_analysis.md or ref_analysis.md)
2. Read pre-analyzed materials from the discovered input paths (each path is a `analysis_project/{paper,doc}/{name}/` or `research/{topic}/` artifact — use the structured analysis files there, NOT external raw PDFs)
3. Consider venue-specific conventions and expectations (for academic modes: rebuttal/paper/review) or domain best practices and industry standards (for professional modes: report/proposal/presentation)

#### Natural-integration rule for paper-body mutations (camera-ready / major revision)

When converting **reviewer concerns / rebuttal materials → paper-body mutations**, apply this **single gating question** before writing any paste-ready block:

> **"Can this reviewer point be naturally integrated into the existing paragraph flow as a 1-2 sentence inline rewrite?"**

- **YES → inline rewrite mutation** (M15-style — good pattern):
  - Label the subsection heading + add 1-2 opening sentences that introduce the framing.
  - Reword the existing paragraph's first sentence to remove redundancy with the new opening (no orphan additions).
  - Connect Figure references in cascade (overall → architectural → unit-module — single zoom-in path).
  - Defer experimental numbers / hyperparameters / verbatim table citations to body paragraphs or Appendix — never inject them into opening / intro paragraphs.
- **NO → drop (or defer to Appendix)** (M11-style — bad pattern, must reject):
  - Anything that exists only as a **rebuttal-format artifact** — model-by-model comparison tables, structured Q&A blocks, point-by-point response paragraphs, "we acknowledge X, Y, Z" enumerations — does NOT belong as a paper-body mutation. Even if the reviewer "strongly recommended integration," a rebuttal-format block pasted verbatim into a camera-ready section will read as awkward and out-of-flow.
  - Mark the mutation as **dropped** in the strategy, with a one-line reason ("rebuttal-format — not naturally integrable into body flow"). If a fragment of the rebuttal material *can* be salvaged as inline body wording, extract only that fragment as an inline rewrite; do NOT preserve the surrounding structure.

**Hard-fail check** — when drafting mutation entries, an entry MUST be rejected if any of the following holds (these are signals that the mutation is mechanically copying a rebuttal artifact rather than integrating naturally):
1. The paste-ready block is a **standalone `\begin{table}` or `\begin{itemize}` enumeration** sourced from rebuttal materials, with no embedding paragraph rewriting around it.
2. The paste-ready block contains verbatim **experiment numbers** ($x.xx \to y.yy$ migrations, hyperparameter listings, dataset enumerations) inside what should be an introductory / framing paragraph.
3. The paste-ready block is **a new `\paragraph{...}` INSERT** that the existing surrounding text does not bridge to — the surrounding paragraphs would still read identically with or without the inserted block, indicating it sits in isolation rather than weaving into the flow.

**Why** (this rule was added 2026-05-19 after the M11 / M15 episode): a previous camera-ready cycle mechanically converted every reviewer concern into a paper-body mutation, producing rebuttal-format tables (e.g., `tab:arch_compare` model comparison) as 🔴 mandatory body inserts. The user explicitly rejected this as "rebuttal자료를 본문에 그대로 가져다 붙이는 게 어색하다 — 자연스럽게 문장으로 녹여 넣을 수 있으면 그렇게 해야지". The natural-integration rule above operationalizes that judgment so future cycles don't repeat the mechanical conversion.

### Tone Auto-Detection (modes: report / proposal / presentation) — **FIRST step before drafting any of the three above templates**

Infer audience tone from the task description and set `tone:` in the strategy frontmatter. **The detected tone propagates to draft generation in autopilot-doc Step 4** — the draft must respect the same constraints.

| Tone | Detection signals | Style constraints |
|---|---|---|
| **administrative** | Task contains Korean keywords "위원회 / 심의 / 사전심의 / 산학협력단 / **정부** / 정부 기관 / 규제 / 검토 요청 / 보고 / 평가단 / 이사회 / 감사 / 사업 보고 / 사후 보고" or English equivalents ("committee / regulatory / **government** / agency review / compliance / board review / pre-screening / audit / status report"); speaker is a student or researcher reporting **upward** to decision-makers (the committee evaluates the speaker; the speaker is NOT pitching to peers or selling). Goal: information presentation + review request, NOT persuasion / sales / investor pitch. | **Plain factual delivery, objective information.** AVOID: marketing superlatives ("genuinely novel", "sole occupied axis", "global rights asset", "world-first"), "X strengths summary" framing, "core message" / "Hook → Call-to-Action" arc, heroic asks ("Approve to secure as global asset"), decision-options box (approve/conditional/hold), animated narrative voice. PREFER: simple fact lists, status updates, calm review request ("검토 부탁드립니다" / "kindly request the committee's review"). Speaker stance: **neutral reporter, not advocate**. |
| **default** | Otherwise — academic conference talk, internal R&D briefing, industry pitch, sales/marketing presentation, investor IR | Existing pitch-deck patterns apply (Hook, Core Message, Story Arc, Call-to-Action, persuasive framing). |

**Why this matters**: Korean administrative presentations (산학협력단 사전심의, 정부 위원회 보고, 규제 기관 사후 보고 등) follow a fundamentally different convention from English-language pitch decks. Without this guard, default LLM patterns lean toward US/English pitch-deck superlatives ("compelling contribution", "single-axis advantage", "secured as a global asset") that are uncomfortable for student presenters and inappropriate for the audience. The same applies to administrative reports/proposals submitted to government agencies or institutional review boards.

### Slide Format Conventions (mode: presentation) — **mandatory in slide outline (Section 4)**

When the strategy includes a slide-by-slide outline (presentation mode Section 4), each slide entry MUST follow these formatting principles. **The same conventions propagate to draft generation in autopilot-doc Step 4.**

**1. Chapter visualization in slide headers**
- Every body-slide title prefixed with `[Ch.N 챕터명]` (Korean) or `[Ch.N Chapter-name]` (English)
- Chapter-transition slides marked with `[Ch.N 챕터명 — 시작]` / `[~ start]`
- Each slide includes a `**챕터**: N. 챕터명 (M장 중 K번째)` meta line below the title — chapter-transition slides add "**챕터 전환**" annotation
- Visual placeholder's first line: `- **상단 헤더 띠**: "N. 챕터명"` (per format-ref Korean industry-academia standard deck) — chapter-transition slides add "Ch.X와 색상/strength를 다르게 — 챕터 전환 시각 신호"

**2. Visual placeholder concreteness**
- AVOID vague terms: "X 카드", "Y 도식", "적절한 시각화", "comparison chart"
- PREFER: (a) diagram type + (b) component list + (c) color/layout hints
- Example: ❌ "학회 위상 카드" → ✅ "NeurIPS / ICLR / ICML 3-row table (h5-index 컬럼 + acceptance-rate 컬럼)"

**3. Table column header clarity**
- AVOID abbreviations or ambiguous headers (e.g., "비교 1위" — comparison with what?)
- PREFER: full Korean/English noun phrases with clear semantic units; add a 1-line column-meaning footnote above the table if helpful

**4. Foreign-language quote → Korean keyword gloss** (mandatory for non-AI audiences)
- Whenever a slide contains an English quote (paper review, citation, technical term), add a Korean appeal-commentary box directly below:
  ```
  > "English quote..."
  > — Source

  📌 **핵심 키워드 — "X"**: 한국어 풀이 1문장
  ```

**5. Speaker notes default = empty (do NOT auto-fill)**
- The strategy outline and the initial draft must NOT auto-fill speaker notes
- Only generate speaker notes when the user explicitly requests as a separate post-polish step
- Reason: speaker notes drift with slide-content edits; auto-fill produces wasted regeneration cost in iterative refinement

**6. No body-bullet ↔ visual redundancy**
- The same fact should NOT appear both in body bullets AND in the visual placeholder
- Body bullets = "what the speaker says"; visual = "what the audience sees at-a-glance"
- If both express the same fact, simplify one of the two

**7. Slide-number consistency on insertion/deletion**
- When inserting/removing a slide, update ALL of the following in the same edit pass:
  - (a) All subsequent slide numbers (`Slide N+1`, `Slide N+2`, ...)
  - (b) Contents slide's chapter slide-counts ("Ch.N (M장)")
  - (c) Changelog entry inside the frontmatter `changelog:` array (per `refine-doc` convention — never a top-of-file HTML comment, which breaks markdown preview when frontmatter is present)
  - (d) Time-budget line in the file's top guide
  - (e) Cross-references in other slides ("Slide M의 ...")
  - (f) Chapter meta lines ("M장 중 K번째")

## Quality Requirements
Every reviewer point must appear in rebuttal strategy (missing a point is a critical error). Severity classification must be justified. All citations must reference actual materials in the discovered input paths (analysis_project/{paper,doc}/, research/{topic}/) — do NOT fabricate. Strategy must be actionable with specific plans, not vague advice. For academic modes (rebuttal/paper/review): apply venue-specific norms (e.g., NeurIPS rebuttal length limits, ICASSP culture). For professional modes (report/proposal/presentation): apply industry best practices relevant to the domain.

Write the strategy file directly. Return ONLY the file path and a 3-5 line Korean summary of the strategy. Do NOT return the strategy content itself.
````

The agent writes the strategy file directly; the orchestrator only receives paths and a summary.

## QA Scaling
Auto-detect from strategy scope. Two reviewer roles run **in parallel** at Standard+:
- **Quality reviewer**: completeness / logical soundness / venue norms / reviewer-coverage (rebuttal)
- **Fact-checker** (NEW): in-artifact materials verbatim 대조 (`analysis_project/paper/cards/*.md`, `analysis_project/doc/*/...`, `research/{topic}/cards/*.md`), citation/venue/metric/year 검증

| Level | Condition | Quality reviewer | Fact-checker (parallel) | Max rounds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | (manual via `--qa quick` only) | 1× 품질관리팀 (`model: "sonnet"`), spot-check만 | _skip_ | **1 (no re-invoke even on 🔴)** |
| **Light** | review/presentation mode, or report with ≤3 input paths | 1× 품질관리팀 (`model: "sonnet"`) | _skip_ | 2 |
| **Standard** | paper/report/proposal mode, or rebuttal with ≤3 reviewers | 1× 품질관리팀 (default opus) | **1× 품질관리팀 fact-check (`model: "sonnet"`)** | 2 |
| **Thorough** | rebuttal with ≥4 reviewers, or report/proposal with ≥10 input items (papers + doc materials) | 2× 품질관리팀 in parallel (opus) | **1× 품질관리팀 fact-check (`model: "sonnet"`)** | 2 |

**Why Sonnet for fact-checker**: in-artifact cards verbatim 대조는 _창의적 판단_이 아닌 _단순 매칭 작업_이라 Sonnet으로 충분, 비용 효율적.

## Post-Strategy Review Loop (max 2 revision rounds; quick = 1 round)
The log directory is the artifact root folder (parent of `strategy/`).
- `mkdir -p {log_dir}/_internal/strategy_reviews` before invoking QA.

After the 연구팀 agent returns:
1. **Invoke quality + fact-check reviewers in parallel** (single message with multiple Agent calls per QA Scaling):

   **Quality reviewer prompt** (opus or sonnet per level):
   ```
   Review this document strategy for completeness and logical soundness.
   Strategy file: [path]. Mode: {mode}.
   For rebuttal mode, verify ALL reviewer points are addressed.
   Do NOT verify individual fact citations (model venue/year/metric) — that's the fact-checker's role.
   Write review to: {log_dir}/_internal/strategy_reviews/round_{N}_quality.md.
   Return ONLY the file path and a one-line verdict.
   ```

   **Fact-checker prompt** (sonnet, parallel — Standard/Thorough only):
   ```
   You are a fact-check focused reviewer — NOT narrative quality.
   Strategy file: [path]. Mode: {mode}. Discovered inputs: {inputs_paths_list}.

   For every domain claim in the strategy (citation / model name / venue / year /
   metric / dataset / lineage / classification), open the corresponding ground-truth
   source and verbatim compare:
   - Paper analyses: `.claude_reports/analysis_project/paper/*.md` (if exists — single source of truth, produced by `/analyze-project --mode paper`)
   - Original PDFs: only if listed in `--inputs` AND paper analyses lack the specific fact
   - Reviewer comments (rebuttal mode): {analysis_dir}/reviewer_analysis.md

   Output a single table (no narrative):
   | Section | Claim in strategy | Source (file:line or section) | Match (✅/❌) | Severity (🔴/🟡) |

   Do NOT comment on completeness, narrative arc, or strategic soundness
   — that's the quality reviewer's job. Stay narrowly on fact verification.

   Cost-aware mode (sonnet): table-only output. Limit to ~30 most material claims.

   Write to: {log_dir}/_internal/strategy_reviews/round_{N}_factcheck.md.
   Return ONLY path + one-line verdict.
   ```

2. **Check verdict (both reviewers):**
   - **No 🔴 from either**: proceed to Korean Version Generation.
   - **qa_level == quick**: after round 1, exit regardless of 🔴. Add 🔴 issues to `## 미해결 이슈` section in the strategy. Proceed to Korean Version Generation.
   - **🔴 from quality reviewer**: re-invoke 연구팀 with quality findings (max 2 rounds).
   - **🔴 from fact-checker**: re-invoke 연구팀 with **mandatory ref-grounding** (re-read named cards/PDFs). Max 2 rounds.
   - **🔴 from both**: re-invoke 연구팀 with combined findings.
3. **If 🔴 issues remain after 2 rounds**: Add to `## 미해결 이슈` section in the strategy, report to user. Tag fact-check residuals with `[FACT-RESIDUAL]`.

## Korean Version Generation
After review loop completes, invoke 연구팀 one final time:
```
Translate mode. Create the Korean version of the finalized strategy.
English strategy file: {strategy_path}
Save Korean version to: {same directory}/strategy_ko.md
Create a full Korean translation (NOT a summary). All sections with same detail.
Code identifiers, paper titles, and technical terms stay in English.
Return ONLY the file path.
```
Then report to the user: English and Korean strategy paths, strategy summary, and QA verdict.
