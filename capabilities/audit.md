# Capability: audit

This is the portable capability contract for `audit`. It defines runtime-neutral meaning and adapter obligations. It is not a Claude Skill file.

## Contract

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Identifier | `audit` |
| Group | `ops` |
| Supported modes | `none` |
| Portable meaning | 산출물·파이프 사후 점검. drift·일관성·누락을 읽기 중심으로 진단한다. |
| Argument shape | `<artifact_path> [--scope auto|facts|style|structure|cross-ref|coverage|all] [--read-only] [--report-only] [--no-fact-check]` |

## Invocation Semantics

Read-only multi-aspect audit / lint for `<artifact-root>/{plans,research,documents}/*` artifacts. Single global entry — auto-detects artifact type from path prefix (plans=code; research=field-survey; documents=doc deliverable). Per-type lint aspects: doc → facts / style / structure / cross-ref / coverage; research → cards 정합성 / Tier consistency / coverage / cross-card; plans → test results / lint / code review / TODO·미구현. Default `--scope auto` — artifact 특성 기반 자동 선택; 사용자 명시는 1순위 override. Report-only — never modifies the artifact. Complementary to autopilot-refine: refine = edit flow, audit = inspect flow.

Adapters may expose this capability through native commands, skill files, prompt instructions, or explicit wrappers. The adapter must report unsupported runtime mechanics instead of silently treating another runtime's native file format as portable.

## Artifact Ownership

Use the shared artifact root rule: prefer `.agent_reports/`; use legacy `.claude_reports/` only when it already exists and `.agent_reports/` does not. Capability-specific output placement follows `core/CONVENTIONS.md` section 5 until this spec is expanded with a stricter per-capability artifact map.

## Role Requirements

Use portable role names from `roles/README.md` and `core/CONVENTIONS.md`. Concrete model names, subagent frontmatter, and runtime-specific tool lists belong in adapter files.

## Guard Requirements

Adapters must preserve the portable invariants relevant to this capability:

- resolve artifact root through `utilities/artifact-root.sh` or equivalent logic;
- enforce git/worktree safety before edits;
- enforce artifact ordering before new durable artifacts;
- enforce spec-read gating when this capability changes spec-backed code or specs;
- use DB memory paths, not runtime-native memory files.

## Adapter Realization

| Adapter | Realization |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `adapters/claude/skills/audit/SKILL.md` is the Claude-native realization; `skills/audit/SKILL.md` is the compatibility reference. |
| Codex | Read this spec and run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability-info audit`. Do not consume `skills/audit/SKILL.md` as native Codex configuration. |

## Compatibility Reference

The historical Claude Skill source remains at `skills/audit/SKILL.md` while this capability is being split into portable and adapter-native layers.
