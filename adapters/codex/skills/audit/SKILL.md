# audit

This is a Codex-native Skill projection generated from the portable capability
contract. It is adapter-owned output, not a legacy compatibility Skill copy.

## Source

- Portable source: `capabilities/audit.md`
- Runtime check: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability-info audit`
- Bootstrap: `adapters/codex/AGENTS.md`

## Use

1. Read `capabilities/audit.md` for the runtime-neutral contract.
2. Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability-info audit`.
3. Obey the reported status:
   - `instruction-only`: use this Skill as Codex guidance plus explicit preflight guards.
   - `tool-contract`: report the named `tool_contract`, run any `tool_contract_check`, and obey `runtime_surface` / `fallback` before claiming full support.
   - `unsupported`: stop or use the reported `fallback`.

## Shape

- Identifier: `audit`
- Supported modes: `none`
- Argument shape: `<artifact_path> [--scope auto|facts|style|structure|cross-ref|coverage|all] [--read-only] [--report-only] [--no-fact-check]`
- Portable meaning: 산출물·파이프 사후 점검. drift·일관성·누락을 읽기 중심으로 진단한다.

## Portable Contract

- Invocation semantics: Read-only multi-aspect audit / lint for `<artifact-root>/{plans,research,documents}/*` artifacts. Single global entry — auto-detects artifact type from path prefix (plans=code; research=field-survey; documents=doc deliverable). Per-type lint aspects: doc → facts / style / structure / cross-ref / coverage; research → cards 정합성 / Tier consistency / coverage / cross-card; plans → test results / lint / code review / TODO·미구현. Default `--scope auto` — artifact 특성 기반 자동 선택; 사용자 명시는 1순위 override. Report-only — never modifies the artifact. Complementary to autopilot-refine: refine = edit flow, audit = inspect flow. Adapters may expose this capability through native commands, skill files, prompt instructions, or explicit wrappers. The adapter must report unsupported runtime mechanics instead of silently treating another runtime's native file format as portable.


## Required Guards

- Before edits: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]`
- Before spec-changing work: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability audit [cwd] [session-id]`
- After actually reading a spec PRD: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh read <prd.md> [session-id]`
- For workflow state: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh mode [cwd] [session-id]`

Do not use legacy compatibility Skill files or non-native adapter Skill files
as Codex-native source. Those files are compatibility/reference surfaces only.
