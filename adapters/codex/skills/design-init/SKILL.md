# design-init

This is a Codex-native Skill projection generated from the portable capability
contract. It is adapter-owned output, not a legacy compatibility Skill copy.

## Source

- Portable source: `capabilities/design-init.md`
- Runtime check: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability-info design-init`
- Bootstrap: `adapters/codex/AGENTS.md`

## Use

1. Read `capabilities/design-init.md` for the runtime-neutral contract.
2. Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability-info design-init`.
3. Obey the reported status:
   - `instruction-only`: use this Skill as Codex guidance plus explicit preflight guards.
   - `tool-contract`: report the named `tool_contract`, run any `tool_contract_check`, and obey `runtime_surface` / `fallback` before claiming full support.
   - `unsupported`: stop or use the reported `fallback`.

## Shape

- Identifier: `design-init`
- Supported modes: `none`
- Argument shape: `<design task description> [--scope ui|slide|icon|diagram|mixed]`
- Portable meaning: 디자인 환경과 state를 bootstrap한다.

## Portable Contract

- Invocation semantics: Design environment check and bootstrap — self-provisions the runtime design harness that powers visual self-verification, plus optional Figma MCP, shadcn/ui, Tailwind tokens, SVG rasterizer, and image-generation integration where supported. Adapter-native files own concrete MCP registration commands and runtime paths. Per spec §0.5 it installs what is missing rather than stopping. Creates design_state.yaml. Adapters may expose this capability through native commands, skill files, prompt instructions, or explicit wrappers. The adapter must report unsupported runtime mechanics instead of silently treating another runtime's native file format as portable.


## Required Guards

- Before edits: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]`
- Before spec-changing work: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability design-init [cwd] [session-id]`
- After actually reading a spec PRD: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh read <prd.md> [session-id]`
- For workflow state: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh mode [cwd] [session-id]`

Do not use legacy compatibility Skill files or non-native adapter Skill files
as Codex-native source. Those files are compatibility/reference surfaces only.
