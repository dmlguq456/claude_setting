# draft-refine

This is a Codex-native Skill projection generated from the portable capability
contract. It is adapter-owned output, not a legacy compatibility Skill copy.

## Source

- Portable source: `capabilities/draft-refine.md`
- Runtime check: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability-info draft-refine`
- Bootstrap: `adapters/codex/AGENTS.md`

## Use

1. Read `capabilities/draft-refine.md` for the runtime-neutral contract.
2. Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability-info draft-refine`.
3. Obey the reported status:
   - `instruction-only`: use this Skill as Codex guidance plus explicit preflight guards.
   - `tool-contract`: report the named `tool_contract`, run any `tool_contract_check`, and obey `runtime_surface` / `fallback` before claiming full support.
   - `unsupported`: stop or use the reported `fallback`.

## Shape

- Identifier: `draft-refine`
- Supported modes: `none`
- Argument shape: `<strategy or draft name or path> [--qa quick|light|standard|thorough|adversarial]`
- Portable meaning: 초안 정련·다듬기. memo/review feedback을 문서 전략이나 draft에 반영한다.

## Portable Contract

- Invocation semantics: Reflect user memos/review feedback in a document strategy or draft. Snapshots prior version under `_internal/versions/v{N}/` (modern; per CONVENTIONS.md §5) or `_v{N}.md` siblings (legacy). Auto-managed `changelog:` array inside YAML frontmatter (NOT a top-of-file HTML comment — that breaks markdown preview when frontmatter is also present). Mandatory ref-grounding per memo (re-read source; override memo if it conflicts with source). Adapters may expose this capability through native commands, skill files, prompt instructions, or explicit wrappers. The adapter must report unsupported runtime mechanics instead of silently treating another runtime's native file format as portable.


## Required Guards

- Before edits: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]`
- Before spec-changing work: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability draft-refine [cwd] [session-id]`
- After actually reading a spec PRD: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh read <prd.md> [session-id]`
- For workflow state: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh mode [cwd] [session-id]`

Do not use legacy compatibility Skill files or non-native adapter Skill files
as Codex-native source. Those files are compatibility/reference surfaces only.
