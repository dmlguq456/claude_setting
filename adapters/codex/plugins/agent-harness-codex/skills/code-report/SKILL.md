# code-report

This is a Codex-native Skill projection generated from the portable capability
contract. It is adapter-owned output, not a legacy compatibility Skill copy.

## Source

- Portable source: `capabilities/code-report.md`
- Runtime check: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability-info code-report`
- Bootstrap: `adapters/codex/AGENTS.md`

## Use

1. Read `capabilities/code-report.md` for the runtime-neutral contract.
2. Run `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability-info code-report`.
3. Obey the reported status:
   - `instruction-only`: use this Skill as Codex guidance plus explicit preflight guards.
   - `tool-contract`: report the named `tool_contract`, run any `tool_contract_check`, and obey `runtime_surface` / `fallback` before claiming full support.
   - `unsupported`: stop or use the reported `fallback`.

## Shape

- Identifier: `code-report`
- Supported modes: `none`
- Argument shape: `<plan name or path>`
- Portable meaning: 코드 작업 사이클 결과를 사용자-facing 보고서로 조립한다.

## Portable Contract

- Invocation semantics: Generate a detailed change report from plan + dev logs — focuses on key changes, principles, and insights for future reference Adapters may expose this capability through native commands, skill files, prompt instructions, or explicit wrappers. The adapter must report unsupported runtime mechanics instead of silently treating another runtime's native file format as portable.


## Required Guards

- Before edits: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]`
- Before spec-changing work: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh capability code-report [cwd] [session-id]`
- After actually reading a spec PRD: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh read <prd.md> [session-id]`
- For workflow state: `adapters/codex/bin/preflight.sh mode [cwd] [session-id]`

Do not use legacy compatibility Skill files or non-native adapter Skill files
as Codex-native source. Those files are compatibility/reference surfaces only.
