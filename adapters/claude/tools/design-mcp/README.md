# design-mcp

Playwright-wrapped MCP server that gives an agent the **visual feedback loop**
at the heart of design work: render a page → see it → read console errors → query the DOM.
Implements the runtime design harness loop used by design capabilities.

## Tools

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `preview({ path, viewportWidth?, viewportHeight?, waitUntil? })` | Load an HTML file into headless Chromium. Resets the console buffer. Serves the project root as a dev server so relative assets / ES modules / fetch resolve. |
| `screenshot({ savePath, steps?, fullPage?, hq?, clip? })` | Capture to PNG/JPEG. `steps[]` run JS + wait before each capture → multiple states (slides, scroll, interactions). Multi-step → `NN-` prefix. Does **not** return pixels (token saving) — use `view_image`. |
| `getConsoleLogs()` | Console logs + errors since last `preview`. First check after every build. |
| `eval_js({ code })` | Run JS in page context (DOM queries, computed styles, interaction tests). Bare expression auto-returned; multi-statement needs explicit `return`. |
| `view_image({ path, maxSize? })` | Load an image as a vision input (downscaled to ≤1000px long edge). |
| `image_metadata({ path })` | Dimensions / format / alpha / animation without sending pixels. |

## CLI Backstops

| command | purpose |
|---|---|
| `node console-check.mjs <file.html>` | Deterministic console/page-error check for design HTML post-write hooks. |
| `node visual-check.mjs <file.html> [--out <dir>] [--viewport <width>x<height>]` | Render one HTML file, capture a screenshot, and report console errors as machine-readable status lines. Codex/OpenCode adapter-owned visual harness wrappers call this checker without projecting the full MCP package. |

## Registration Boundary

This package is portable tool source. Runtime-specific registration belongs in
adapter docs. The Claude Code realization is documented in
`adapters/claude/ADAPTATION.md`.

The static server roots at the launch cwd (the project). Override with `DESIGN_ROOT=/abs/path`.
Browsers resolve from the default Playwright cache (`~/.cache/ms-playwright`).

## Smoke test

```bash
npm run smoke
```

Validates §2.5 of the spec: preview→screenshot→view_image round-trip, console-error capture,
`eval_js` computed-style query, two-state `screenshot.steps`. All deps are pinned in
`package-lock.json`.

## Used by

`autopilot-design` (design-init self-provisions & smoke-tests it; design-components /
design-review / design-tokens render through it). Replaces the older ad-hoc
`preview_screenshot` + per-tool rasterizer references.
