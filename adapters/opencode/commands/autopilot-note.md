description: "Run the portable autopilot-note capability through the OpenCode adapter. Meaning: 산출물 라우팅/노트화. digest와 triage 제안을 만든다."
---

Use the OpenCode adapter realization of portable capability `autopilot-note`.
This is adapter-owned output generated from `capabilities/autopilot-note.md`, not a runtime-specific command copy.

1. Read `capabilities/autopilot-note.md` for the runtime-neutral contract.
2. Run `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability-info autopilot-note` and
   obey `instruction-only`, `tool-contract`, or `unsupported` status. For
   `tool-contract`, report the named `tool_contract`, run any
   `tool_contract_check`, and obey `runtime_surface` / `fallback` before
   claiming full support. For `unsupported`, stop or use the reported
   `fallback`.
3. Before edits, run `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]`.
4. Before spec-changing work, run
   `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability autopilot-note [cwd] [session-id]`.
5. If the command receives arguments, map them to the portable argument shape:
   `[--scope today|yesterday|since <date>|all] [--target <notes-root>] [--dry-run] [--qa quick|light|standard|thorough|adversarial] [--digest-only] [--triage-only] [--source <list>] [--no-fact-check]`.

Portable contract excerpt:

- Invocation semantics: Autopilot family — periodic + on-demand 산출물 routing pipeline (2-Layer 모델). Scans `<artifact-root>/{research,documents,plans,analysis_project}/` + `experiments/` + `git log` for artifacts changed since last run, then turns each into a **Layer 2 산출물 노트** under `<agent-notes-root>/_layer2/notes/<id>.md` and links it to the user's **Layer 1** board cards under `<agent-notes-root>/cards/`. 5-way routing — create L2 note row (auto), link note `card_id` → existing L1 card (auto-PROPOSE as `routing_status: inbox` with `routing_confidence`/`routing_reason`; unattended cron NEVER auto-confirms — user confirms in `/triage`), link `backbone_ids`/`task_ids` → L2 catalog (auto, emerge if needed), propose new L1 card (triage), park as ambient `card_id: null` note (auto fallback). Daily digest accumulates at `<agent-notes-root>/digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Idempotent — same source processed twice never duplicates a note. Default `--qa light` (routine cron). Escalate to standard+ for weekly bulk consolidation, Notion migration, or pre-handoff cleanup. Source 6 includes Notion mirror (Phase 3, gated). Adapters may expose this capability through native commands, skill files, prompt instructions, or explicit wrappers. The adapter must report unsupported runtime mechanics instead of silently treating another runtime's native file format as portable.

as OpenCode-native command source.
