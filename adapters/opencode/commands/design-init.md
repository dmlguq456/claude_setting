description: "Run the portable design-init capability through the OpenCode adapter. Meaning: 디자인 환경과 state를 bootstrap한다."
---

Use the OpenCode adapter realization of portable capability `design-init`.
This is adapter-owned output generated from `capabilities/design-init.md`, not a Claude command copy.

1. Read `capabilities/design-init.md` for the runtime-neutral contract.
2. Run `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability-info design-init` and
   obey `instruction-only`, `tool-contract`, or `unsupported` status. For
   `tool-contract`, report the named `tool_contract` and run any
   `tool_contract_check` before claiming full support.
3. Before edits, run `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]`.
4. Before spec-changing work, run
   `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability design-init [cwd] [session-id]`.
5. If the command receives arguments, map them to the portable argument shape:
   `<design task description> [--scope ui|slide|icon|diagram|mixed]`.

Do not use `adapters/claude/commands/` or Claude slash-command files as
OpenCode-native command source.
