description: "Run the portable draft-refine capability through the OpenCode adapter. Meaning: 초안 정련·다듬기. memo/review feedback을 문서 전략이나 draft에 반영한다."
---

Use the OpenCode adapter realization of portable capability `draft-refine`.
This is adapter-owned output generated from `capabilities/draft-refine.md`, not a runtime-specific command copy.

1. Read `capabilities/draft-refine.md` for the runtime-neutral contract.
2. Run `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability-info draft-refine` and
   obey `instruction-only`, `tool-contract`, or `unsupported` status. For
   `tool-contract`, report the named `tool_contract`, run any
   `tool_contract_check`, and obey `runtime_surface` / `fallback` before
   claiming full support. For `unsupported`, stop or use the reported
   `fallback`.
3. Before edits, run `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]`.
4. Before spec-changing work, run
   `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability draft-refine [cwd] [session-id]`.
5. If the command receives arguments, map them to the portable argument shape:
   `<strategy or draft name or path> [--qa quick|light|standard|thorough|adversarial]`.

Portable contract excerpt:

- Invocation semantics: Reflect user memos/review feedback in a document strategy or draft. Snapshots prior version under `_internal/versions/v{N}/` (modern; per CONVENTIONS.md §5) or `_v{N}.md` siblings (legacy). Auto-managed `changelog:` array inside YAML frontmatter (NOT a top-of-file HTML comment — that breaks markdown preview when frontmatter is also present). Mandatory ref-grounding per memo (re-read source; override memo if it conflicts with source). Adapters may expose this capability through native commands, skill files, prompt instructions, or explicit wrappers. The adapter must report unsupported runtime mechanics instead of silently treating another runtime's native file format as portable.


User arguments from OpenCode: `$ARGUMENTS`

Do not use non-OpenCode command files or runtime-specific slash-command files
as OpenCode-native command source.
