usage: distill-worker.sh <session-id> [cwd]

OpenCode transcript distillation proposal worker.

STATUS: tool-contract. The shared memory CLI has an OpenCode session source
reader based on `opencode export <session-id>`, so distill-delta works through
adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh.

This proposal worker must not auto-apply memory mutations until an OpenCode
no-tools worker contract is verified. Candidate: `opencode run --agent
<restricted-agent>` with deny permissions, or a future plugin-mediated worker.
Set OPENCODE_DISTILL_ENABLE=1 only when testing that contract.

Verification finding (vs codex's OS-level read-only sandbox): `opencode run
--agent <agent>` with `tools:` off / `permission: deny` does block writes, but
the boundary is framework-soft (the model declines, or repeatedly retries the
denied tool) rather than an OS-enforced read-only filesystem. Under an
adversarial "use any tool to write" prompt the run can retry-loop and hang
instead of failing fast, which would stall an automatic session-end dispatch.
This is below the codex bar for the D-14 trust boundary, so OpenCode auto-distill
stays disabled; the preferred enablement path is a plugin-mediated worker that
hard-strips tool execution, not `opencode run --agent`.
