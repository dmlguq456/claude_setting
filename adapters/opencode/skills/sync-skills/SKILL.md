# sync-skills

This is an OpenCode-native Skill projection generated from the portable
capability contract. It is adapter-owned output, not a legacy compatibility Skill copy.

## Source

- Portable source: `capabilities/sync-skills.md`
- Runtime check: `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability-info sync-skills`
- Bootstrap: `adapters/opencode/AGENTS.md`

## Use

1. Read `capabilities/sync-skills.md` for the runtime-neutral contract.
2. Run `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability-info sync-skills`.
3. Obey the reported status:
   - `instruction-only`: use this Skill as OpenCode guidance plus explicit preflight guards.
   - `tool-contract`: report the named `tool_contract`, run any `tool_contract_check`, and obey `runtime_surface` / `fallback` before claiming full support.
   - `unsupported`: stop or use the reported `fallback`.

## Shape

- Identifier: `sync-skills`
- Supported modes: `none`
- Argument shape: `[--check] [--force] [--auto-fix [--dry-run]]`
- Portable meaning: 정의 변경을 읽어 README/manifest/cross-doc invariant drift를 점검·동기화한다.

## Portable Contract

- Invocation semantics: Skills + Agents 정의 변경을 감지해 <agent-home>/README.md (GitHub) 의 대시보드 (워크플로우 map + cheat-sheet + 통합 가이드라인) 를 동기화한다. drift 체크 전용 모드도 지원. Adapters may expose this capability through native commands, skill files, prompt instructions, or explicit wrappers. The adapter must report unsupported runtime mechanics instead of silently treating another runtime's native file format as portable.


## Required Guards

- Before edits: `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh write <file> [session-id]`
- Before spec-changing work: `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh capability sync-skills [cwd] [session-id]`
- After actually reading a spec PRD: `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh read <prd.md> [session-id]`
- For workflow state: `adapters/opencode/bin/preflight.sh mode [cwd] [session-id]`

Do not use legacy compatibility Skill files or non-native adapter Skill files
as OpenCode-native source. Those files are compatibility/reference surfaces only.
